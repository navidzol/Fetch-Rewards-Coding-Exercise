# Fetch-Rewards-Coding-Exercise
A simple code to compare two texts and provide a metric that indicates the similarity between two cases.

To run this code you should give two texts (lets call them text1 and text2). Then you can call the class called TextComparison with two texts and run the method called "score_evaluation". So the example will be:
from text_comparison import *
s = TextComparison(text1, text2)
s.score_evaluation()
